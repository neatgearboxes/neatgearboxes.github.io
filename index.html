            <p>And don’t forget, we have a large range of stock and can source hard-to-find parts. We can also offer
                professional advice on the suitability of your second-hand parts as part of our service.</p>
            <p>*spider gears are processed for free in the context of a gearbox or crown wheel &amp; pinion package</p>
            <p>^crown wheel must already be removed from differential. This charge applies to transaxles - where the
                final drive is internal to the gearbox.</p>

            <h2>ISF/REM</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>Ideal for classic restorations and dirt bike/quad applications, where you want to improve shifting and
                reduce heat generated by the gear set, while improving gear fatigue resistance - a great low cost
                option. Simply send us all your disassembled gears, shafts, shifter rails, forks and shift barrel.</p>
            <p>This is also a fantastic option when undertaking a differential rebuild - your crown wheel and pinion
                will be quieter, stronger and produce less heat after being ISF processed by Neat Gearboxes. Includes
                the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hot tank/cold dip components</li>

    <p>Shot peening is a cold work process, where a workpiece such as a gear is bombarded with small spheres of metal in
        a controlled environment. When done properly (i.e. to recognised international standards), shot peening adds a
        uniform compressive layer to the surface of components, and in doing so drastically reduces the possibility of
        crack formation on a surface.</p>
    <p>Shot peening has been proven to increase gear fatigue strength by 30% and in some cases 49%. Neat Gearboxes
        offers shot peening to SAE J2441 standards as part of our upgrade package, which along with our Isotropic
        Superfinishing (ISF), seriously improves the fatigue strength of transmission internals.</p>
    <p>Check out our short video</p>
    <h3>What is Isotropic Super-Finishing?</h3>
    <p>ISF (often referred to as REM, although this is a proprietary name of a similar process) is another industry
        proven method for improving the fatigue-resistance of gears.</p>
    <p>By chemically finishing the surface of metals down to extremely low roughness levels in specialised vibratory
        finishing machines, the workpiece is left with a non-directional mirror finish. This incredibly uniform surface
        reduces the likelihood of stress risers (re)occurring. SAE investigations have proven that ISF-treated gears
        last exponentially longer than those that have not been ISF treated. ISF can be used as a stand-alone process or
        ideally in conjunction with shot peening of gears.</p>
    <p>Due to the very fine surface finish, gear friction is also greatly reduced, meaning your gearbox produces less
        heat and thus transmits more power to the wheels.</p>
    <p>Neat Gearboxes are proud to have specialised ISF machinery in-house.</p>
    <h3>What causes gears to break?</h3>
    <p>Without wanting to sound too classroom-ish, what is important to understand when talking about gear strength is
        that almost without exception gear failure occurs due to fatigue cracks, not an inherent lack of overall
        strength (ultimate tensile strength). What this means is that improving fatigue strength and preventing cracks
        should be the main concern, or first step, when upgrading transmissions.</p>
    <p>There are many contributing factors to the formation of metal fatigue cracks,  but by far the most common would
        be stress risers. Stress risers are almost always related to manufacturing process or inherent design
        weaknesses. They are the “weak link” in what otherwise may be an extremely strong component, and act as a
        catalyst for crack formation and amplify metal fatigue. Some examples of stress risers include surface
        disruptions such as casting flashes, forging seams, sharp edges left by machining processes, and other
        imperfections in the surface of metals from, for example, honing or grinding. Stress risers are more often than
        not the first point of crack formation and one of the most common reasons for gearbox component failure.</p>
    <p>Factory-standard gears can be made remarkably strong by simply eliminating these stress risers. removing sharp
        edges, deburring forging seams, and polishing imperfections all reduce the likelihood of crack formation. How
        this is done, though, is extremely important. Some shops "polish" the gears with a die grinder or flapper disc.
        Based on in-depth research, this has been found to be counterintuitive. While there is occasionally a place for
        this before other processes, it should never just be left as-is. This is because the very act of grinding and
        deburring can penetrate the case hardening of the gears, and introduce more stress risers. Where necessary, Neat
        Gearboxes remove significant forging flashes etc, but only before shot peening and ISF so as to eliminate the
        possibility of the repair turning into a stress riser itself. The best ways to uniformly ensure that stress
        risers do not occur are through shot peening and ISF.</p>
    <p>Another reason why gears break is when bearings fail. This can happen from misalignment, lack of lubrication,
        overheating or a combination of all of these factors. This is why we check critical dimensions such as <strong>case
            alignment</strong> and <strong>shaft runout</strong> in the course of our rebuilds. A transmission case that
        is even slightly misaligned will lead to excessive strain on the gear train and premature failure. We also pay
        careful attention to lubrication and make improvements to oil feeds and tracks to ensure that your gearbox is
        adequately lubricated. We can make recommendations in regards to temperature control, including Thermal
        Dispersant coatings, external oil coolers and pumps. We use and recommend only the best components and fluids.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, Gears can break because of contaminants in the oil. Small metal particles that build up in gearboxes and
        diffs will eat through the hardened surface over a period of time. Filtration is very rare in standard
        gearboxes, so that is why we strongly recommend the use of Dimple magnetic drain plugs. We also recommend
        regular gear oil changes: once a year/20,000km for a street drive vehicle, and shorter intervals for motorsport
        applications.</p>
    <h3>Why is heat bad in a gearbox or diff?</h3>
    <p>Heat is a product of friction between meshing gears and is inevitable in a gearbox or differential. Maintaining
        heat at stable levels is crucial for a number of reasons. Most importantly, a correctly assembled gearbox or
        diff has finely adjusted preloads and clearances, which allow for the metal components to expand and contract.
        These tolerances are critical for normal bearing operation.
         
        If components (and the gear oil) get hotter than they should; that is, hotter than the preloads and clearances
        allow for, parts may expand to the point where rotating components are no longer sufficiently separated for an
        oil film to form. This problem is amplified when the heat rises outside of the operating range of the gear oil
        being used. Metal rubbing against metal in most situations is not a good thing. Too much heat can cause massive
        damage in a gearbox or diff and this sort of damage will always require major repair and probably replacement of
        many expensive components, such as bearings, gears, pinions and hubs.
         
        Another critical reason why heat is bad is because it actually robs power. Energy from the engine is transferred
        through the driveline (gearbox and diff) to the wheels. When the gears intermesh they create heat. That heat
        requires energy – and takes it from the kinetic energy of your engine. This is part of what is called driveline
        loss, and is one of the reasons why vehicles have more power at the crankshaft than the wheels.
         
        Excessive heat is a symptom that your driveline is sapping too much power. The only real way to control this is
        to lower gear friction.</p>
    <h3>How can I control the temperature of my gearbox or diff?</h3>
    <p>By Isotropic Super-Finishing (ISF) your gears: Smoother surfaces create less friction. Heat in a gearbox or diff
        is a product of friction from intermeshing gears. Therefore, smoother gear surfaces create less heat. Simple.
        ISF is the best and most economical way to reduce heat output from gears, period. Neat Gearboxes offer ISF as
        one of our core services - nothing makes gears smoother.</p>
    <p>By using quality gear oil and changing it regularly: Gear oil plays a crucial role of heat transfer and friction
        reduction in your gearbox and diff. There is a difference between good oils and bad, and there are different
        applications for those good oils. Neat recommends a range of quality gear oils for different applications, and
        recommends changing gear oil every 20,000km/1 year for road use. Vehicles used for racing applications may
        require gear oil changes much more frequently. Contact us if you are unsure of intervals.</p>
    <p>By using a Thermal Dispersant (TD) coating on the housing: This helps the gear oil to transfer heat into the
        atmosphere via the housing/casing. See “What is Thermal Dispersant (TD) and why do I need it?</p>
    <p>If your gearbox or diff is still running too hot after these modifications, the best way to control excessive
        heat is through using external gear oil coolers. They are a surefire way of preventing the excessive expansion
        of components in your gearbox, by keeping gear oil temperature within the specified operating range. Neat
        Gearboxes are currently working on putting together a number of gear oil cooler packages for popular makes.</p>
    <h3>What should I send you for the Peen and Polish Package?</h3>
    <p>While items vary between gearboxes, a general list may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>all gears including clusters</li>
        <li>all shafts</li>
        <li>hubs and sleeves</li>
        <li>shift rails</li>
        <li>forks (steel/iron only)</li>
        <li>shifter ends</li>
        <li>crown wheel</li>
        <li>spider gears and shafts</li>
        <li>shifter barrels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We only process ferrous materials - we don't peen or ISF brass or aluminium.</p>
    <h3>How should I package my gears for shipping?</h3>
    <p>This is crucial. We take a lot of care in packaging customers' gears for return shipping, but we often see them
        just tossed in a box and sent to us without much thought. Who knows what damage occurs during shipping - it may
        be the case that chipped teeth and cracks have occurred at this point.</p>
    <p>We recommend wrapping everything in multiple layers of newspaper so that the components cannot knock against each
        other in transit. Then choose a box in which everything fits snugly, and fill up the voids in the box with more
        scrunched up newspaper or other filling material. Usually the parcel is relatively heavy for its size, so use
        plenty of masking tape to keep the box from coming apart. Often inserting another layer of cardboard inside the
        packing box is helpful if it seems a bit flimsy.</p>
    <p>While you don't need to thoroughly clean the items (we hot tank and thoroughly clean them as part of the
        package), it's best not to send them dripping in gear oil, which might seep out into your cardboard box and
        weaken it, along with annoying the poor courier by stinking out her shiny new van.</p>
